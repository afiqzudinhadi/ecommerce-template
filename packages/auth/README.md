# @repo/auth

Helper tools package for Clerk authentication. As of now, this helper package is not being used anywhere in the repo.

Due to Clerk's implementations for different frameworks, each app (Next.js, Remix, etc.) have its own Clerk setup. This package is intended to provide shared utilities and types that can be used across these implementations.
